# Provenance in XML format

## Schema Documentation

The documentation of the XML schema is available in this repository. The documentation is built from the documentation annotation tags in the .xsd files.

The documentation can be rebuild with:

```
sh generate_documentation.sh
```

This script uses `xsltproc` together with the [xs3p](https://xml.fiforms.org/xs3p/) to create a .html file for each .xsd file. You have to install `xsltproc` to rebuild the schema documentation. For CentOS this is done by:

```
yum install libxslt
```

## Update documentation

If a new .xsd file was added, update the files `xs3p/links.xml` and `generate_documentation.sh`. The lines are very generic, so this shouldn't be a problem.

Then recreate the new documentation:

``
sh generate_documentation.sh
``
